# React Performance

This project illustrates the uses React's useMemo and useCallback hooks to boost performance. With useMemo, it caches expensive calculations, preventing unnecessary repeats and speeding up rendering. Meanwhile, useCallback ensures callback functions are only recreated when needed, minimizing unnecessary re-renders. Together, these hooks make the application more efficient by optimizing how resources are utilized during rendering.
